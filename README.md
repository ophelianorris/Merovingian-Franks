## Welcome to the Dark Ages.

What do you know about the Dark Ages?

The early Middle Ages are a fascinating, frightening and even funny period of history. 

They also have the much more exciting title, "Dark Ages", which refers to the period of roughly 450-750 AD in Western Europe.

# Why do they matter?

This period helps us understand our world today.  

Even though today's world (our culture, society and economy) is vastly different, people's humanity remains the same. This period provides essential context to the millenium and a half in between.

It is also a jaw-droppingly thrilling era. From brothers betraying brothers, to civil war, strife, magical men and miracle-workers, the Dark Ages themselves and the sources we have from them rival the likes of *Game of Thrones*.

And yet, you probably never studied it in school.

# How do we know about the Dark Ages?

Most of what we know about the Dark Ages, especially about the sixth century, comes from just one source: a history book, written by a Bishop central France, named **Gregory of Tours**. 

He wrote a tale of **magic, murder and miracles**.
