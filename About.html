<h1> About </h1>

I am an RMA student of Medieval History at Utrecht University. <br> 

Previously, I obtained my History BA at Kingâ€™s College, London, and focused on Merovingian Francia. <br> 

I now workw primarily on Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages, mostly in Western Europe, and especially in Francia. <br> 

I am most interested in cultural and religious history, especially in relics and models of sanctity. <br>

I would ultimately like to understand the relationship between society and sanctity, particularly regarding death, burial, memory, the natural world and sanctitude in the Global Middle Ages.
