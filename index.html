  <h1>Surviving the Dark Ages</h1>
  <p>
  What do you know about the Dark Ages? <br>

Today, you will be introduced to the fascinating, frightening and even funny period of the early Middle Ages. 

It also has the much more exciting title, "Dark Ages", which refers to the period of roughly 450-750 AD in Western Europe.

<h2>Why do they matter?</h2><br>

This period is vital for understanding our world today. It is at the end of the **Roman Empire**, during the birth of **Mohammed** and expansion of the Islamic Empire, and before the reign of **Charlemagne**. 

It is in this period that the difference between Western "Catholic" and Eastern "Orthodox" **Christianities** begin to take hold. 

It is in this period that the Mediterrean **slave** trade begins. 

It is in this period that the **pagans**, worshipping strange gods and trees, are persecuted and ended throughout most of Europe.

Even though today's world (our culture, society and economy) is vastly different, the seeds of today can be found here, and provide essential context to the millenium and a half in between. 

And yet, you never studied it in school.

<h2> How do we know about the Dark Ages? <h2><br>

Most of what we know about the Dark Ages, especially about the sixth century, comes from just one source: a history book, written by a Bishop central France, named **Gregory of Tours**. 

He wrote a tale of **magic, murder and miracles**.
