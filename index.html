  <h1>Merovingian Francia: The Depths of the Dark Ages</h1>
  <p>
  What do you know about the Dark Ages? <br> <p>

The early Middle Ages are a fascinating, frightening and even funny period of history. <br> <p>

They also have the much more exciting title, "Dark Ages", which refers to the period of roughly 450-750 AD in Western Europe. <br> <p>

<h2>Why do they matter?</h2><br>

This period helps us understand our world today. 

Even though today's world (our culture, society and economy) is vastly different, people's humanity remains the same. <br> <p>
  
This period provides essential context to the millenium and a half in between. <br> <p>

It is also a jaw-droppingly thrilling era. From brothers betraying brothers, to civil war, strife, magical men and miracle-workers, the Dark Ages themselves and the sources we have from them rival the likes of "Game of Thrones". <br> <p>

And yet, you probably never studied it in school. <br> <p>

<h2> How do we know about the Dark Ages? </h2><br>

Most of what we know about the Dark Ages, especially about the sixth century, comes from just one source: a history book, written by a Bishop central France, named Gregory of Tours. <br> <p>

He wrote a tale of magic, murder and miracles. <br> <p>
  
  Below is a copy of the English translation of his History book, "The History of the Franks". <br> <p>
